Recently, Emojis have flooded everything, from messaging services to advertisements. Emojis are everywhere. Places where they did not exist, are not *updating* to include them. Emojis cover a byte size space, and yet express worth sentences at times. (Or do they?) 

## Fake or real expression?

Next time you type out a emoji, think, did you really express the emotion to convey in real world? Or it was there in the mind and did not make through? Or did you not feel it at all, but felt a social obligation to send one? 

## My Observation

I have realized, many a times, I do not really feel a particular emotion, and yet I end up sending many emoticons. This action is usually a "Goodwill" gesture. The more I think of emojis being real or fake, the more confused I get. 
	
    â€¢ Isn't emoji just an extention for expressing when just text can't convey the expression enough?
