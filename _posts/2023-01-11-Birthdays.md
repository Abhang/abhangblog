## How do I remember birthdays?

I have realized that remembering dates, data, etc. is very difficult for me. My mind percieves those as unnecessary for some reason, and ends up removing that infomration from the long term storage. 

However, one mechanism that I have created for me to remember important dates, is to put it on Google Calendar whenever some birthday comes up. This way, I do not forget it at all ever!
