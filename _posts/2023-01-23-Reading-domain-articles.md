Reading Supply Chain articles daily keeps me up-to-date with all the latest advancement and learnings <!--more-->in my domain of work.

# Why read `"Work Stuff`" other than at work time?

I used to believe that I want to limit my work between my work timings only, and no other time of the day will I ever think about work. It was not that I was of the opinion that work should not be more than the hours it is paying me for, but, I wanted to do my best in the hours that should be sufficient with my highest focus. I believe I could work with pin-point focus in the 8 hours, and make great progress. But that does not work!

# Why does't limiting work to work-hours work?

Work these days is more than for earning money at the end of the month. If you work for earning money at the end of the month, you are probably not doing what you should be. If my passion is working in Supply Chain and I switch to software, I would definitely be trying to earn and not enjoy my eight working hours of the day. 
I want work to be pervasive throughout your activities of the day. When I talk about Supply Chains, I am not talking about work at all. I am talking about my subject of interest, and it happens to be my full time profession. It is a hobby vis-a-vis my job!

If you box your work to the eight hours, you are doing good to your personal life, but is it the best?

# Goal of Working: Why do you work? 

Work is not just for earning today, but for the returns of tomorrow as well. If I box my work to eight hours strictly, it is not impossible to excel at my work as well. But, it becomes a little difficult. You need to manage your time really well, and you have to learn to work quickly. However, I work not only for earning, but for having fun. I enjoy scrutinizing problems, finding solutions, saving millions of dollars for Fortune 500 firms. It gives me a sense of purpose, a feeling of achievement. Cheery on the top - salary at the end of the month.  
Now, when I enjoy what I do, don't I want to be the best at what I do majority part of the day? 
Easiest way for me in my domain to be more knowledgable is to read more about Supply Chain innovations, news etc everyday to keep myself updated. It also allows my mind to churn out new ideas as I learn new things that I can apply in some way in my own work. 

# How to absorb better when reading articles of your domain?

It's simple! Just understand thorrowly. I was recently reading an article about [Party City filing Chapter 11](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/party-city-bankruptcy-filings-detail-case/640836/). I wanted to know Chapter 11 better, so I googled and read about it from official US government website. It was very interesting. I learnt something new!

I truly believe that if you find something ineresting, you will do really well doing anything remotely related to the field. Chapter 11 is none of Supply Chain's business overall, but some of the terms do impact how companies act on Supply Chain when undergoing Chapter 11. 

> Always read new and interesting stuff! Read an article a day related to your work, and you will improve soo much over time!!
