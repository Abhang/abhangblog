title : 'When feeling like life is not going right'
---

On a Tuesday afternoon, here I am, feeling uncomfortable. Why? I don't know. <!--more-->Just doesn't feel right. There is no problem in life, but time is not in my hands feels like. 

# Things just appear to not be in control

Most of the times, I have realized it was a self-control issue. I was not following what I stood for. When I knew I should be planning my day better, but I ended up not doing it. I decided to be sharp focused on one thing, and not do multiple things at a time, but I ended up listening to music and reading an article at the same time.

# Gain Control

We know how to get control, it is simple. Drop everything you are doing and get back to work. But is it that easy? No!! 
Here is what I did to gain self control -
I decided to call a friend and spent clost to ten minutes talking. After that, I decided to chalk out my to-do list for the day, and I prioritized the list. Once that was done, I decided to chalk out what I feel like doing for the next two hours, breaking down the time in chunks of fifteen minutes each. With clarity in mind, I attacked my tasks and had a productive time. 


# Is that how easy it is?
"Sometimes I am feeling too low to begin with a task"
In such scenarios, I believe one should just relax a little bit and just give some more time to the mind. It is okay to have a small break. But remember to get back to the goals next day!

"I don't have a friend to talk to!"
Trust me, you do. Open your WhatsApp and browse through the contacts you have there. Even if you have not spoken to a friend in a long time, call! Catch-up!


"Not sure if this will work out for me"
Try! [And let me know if it works or not!](/contact/)


# Plan your day! It is extremely important that you plan your day!
Make a plan of the day ideally one day in advance at night. Break down the next day in intervals of 15 minutes each, and plan each activity meticulusly. You don't have to be hard on yourself from day 1. But start small. Be hard for the first two hours, next day follow for 4 hours and so on. Bit by bit, eat it all up. 
I can assure you there is no other *gyan* needed to achieve whatever you have in mind!

> To a sincere student, every day is a fortunate day. Time passes but he never lags behind. Neither glory nor shame can move him.
