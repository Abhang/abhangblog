## This is my first blog post on this website

Hopefully, I realize that blogging everyday using this GitHub pull is very easy, and I am able to share my thoights with the world unlike **Creed (The office)**. 
I am hoping to write every single day and keep it open for the world to read. Also, my aim is to have a lot of content churned out and increasing in quality every single day progressivly. 

## Why need a lot of content?

When there is a lot of content on the blog, it becomes easy to structure the blog or make a website with it. I will put up a beautiful blog once I am able to do that.
