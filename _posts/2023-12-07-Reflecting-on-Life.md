title : 'Reflecting on Life'
---

I spoke to a close friend of mine, for more than an hour, and<!--more--> it gave me a lot to think about.

# How did I end up calling him?

I woke up early,around 6.30 my time, and then spent some time working on a personal project, which requires me to look at the laptop screen, do some research, write some code etc. But I enjoy doing it, and I look forward to working on it in the morning when I am going to go sleep at night. 
Today, when I woke up and was working on it, I felt like I had achieved my first goal in my current timeline, the more work I was putting in would simply not be that good an ROI. Should I stop and move on? Should I still keep working on it despite the fact that ROI has been achieved already?

I felt some disconnect, and it got me thinking. I also started thinking about life in general, and am I truly enjoying my life? Maybe I am, looking at what is happening in Middle East,  people living in Gaza, I  think I am so much more fortunate, and living in a safe place. But, am I really making the most of the fortunate life? What do I enjoy? What would I enjoy today? My answer to my own self - Talking to good old friends whom I haven't connected in a long time. 

# How did it go?

Talking to old friends is one of the best things one can do (in my opinion). I reconnected with him, recollected some old memories that we had in undergrad, and then it began! This friend of mine is a story teller, writer, and a lot more. But more than anything, he is a caring friend. 
Last time I had called, I had shared some difficulties I was facing in my life, and he politely asked me all the  updates, and then naratted a beautiful story to me which would help me make a few important decisions. He had written that story few days back.
