title : 'Reflecting on Life'
---

I spoke to a close friend of mine, for more than an hour, and<!--more--> it gave me a lot to think about.

# How did I end up calling him?

I woke up early,around 6.30 my time, and then spent some time working on a personal project, which requires me to look at the laptop screen, do some research, write some code etc. But I enjoy doing it, and I look forward to working on it in the morning when I am going to go sleep at night. 
Today, when I woke up and was working on it, I felt like I had achieved my first goal in my current timeline, the more work I was putting in would simply not be that good an ROI. Should I stop and move on? Should I still keep working on it despite the fact that ROI has been achieved already?

I felt some disconnect, and it got me thinking. I also started thinking about life in general, and am I truly enjoying my life? Maybe I am, looking at what is happening in Middle East,  people living in Gaza, I  think I am so much more fortunate, and living in a safe place. But, am I really making the most of the fortunate life? What do I enjoy? What would I enjoy today? My answer to my own self - Talking to good old friends whom I haven't connected in a long time. 

# How did it go?

Talking to old friends is one of the best things one can do (in my opinion). I reconnected with him, recollected some old memories that we had in undergrad, and then it began! This friend of mine is a story teller, writer, and a lot more. But more than anything, he is a caring friend. 
Last time I had called, I had shared some difficulties I was facing in my life, and he politely asked me all the  updates, and then naratted a beautiful story to me which would help me make a few important decisions. He had written that story few days back.

# Goal of Working: Why do you work? 

Work is not just for earning today, but for the returns of tomorrow as well. If I box my work to eight hours strictly, it is not impossible to excel at my work as well. But, it becomes a little difficult. You need to manage your time really well, and you have to learn to work quickly. However, I work not only for earning, but for having fun. I enjoy scrutinizing problems, finding solutions, saving millions of dollars for Fortune 500 firms. It gives me a sense of purpose, a feeling of achievement. Cheery on the top - salary at the end of the month.  
Now, when I enjoy what I do, don't I want to be the best at what I do majority part of the day? 
Easiest way for me in my domain to be more knowledgable is to read more about Supply Chain innovations, news etc everyday to keep myself updated. It also allows my mind to churn out new ideas as I learn new things that I can apply in some way in my own work. 

# How to absorb better when reading articles of your domain?

It's simple! Just understand thorrowly. I was recently reading an article about [Party City filing Chapter 11](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/party-city-bankruptcy-filings-detail-case/640836/). I wanted to know Chapter 11 better, so I googled and read about it from official US government website. It was very interesting. I learnt something new!

I truly believe that if you find something ineresting, you will do really well doing anything remotely related to the field. Chapter 11 is none of Supply Chain's business overall, but some of the terms do impact how companies act on Supply Chain when undergoing Chapter 11. 

> Always read new and interesting stuff! Read an article a day related to your work, and you will improve soo much over time!!
