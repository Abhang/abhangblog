title : 'Scared of an approaching Exam'
---

I have an exam coming up, and I am scared of not performing<!--more--> upto my expectations in general from myself.

# My GMAT is in two days, I am feeling underprepared.

Whenever I am not prepared about something, I tend to run away from it. I see myself running away from working on it. Now, I have GMAT in two days, and I am not able to function the way I would like myself to be. Let me think if there is a consultant's way of approaching this problem.

> Identify the problem
> What is the missing part of the puzzzle
> Can we fix it? Yes or No?
> If Yes, what is the strategy that needs to be followed,and how much time will it take? Do we have the time needed?
> If No, then what best can be done? In the time available at hand?
> Prepare the action plan.
> Follow the action plan, reaccess in every two hours and plan the course of action. Do not get stuck in fear.

# Why should one be not scared?

Although I am the  first person who will get scared of exams, but I for sure know deep within that it simply does not make sense. Why should one be scared if one can be one with the truth. What will happen will happen, there is not denying that, but at this stage of life, I am not in a shape where this exam will be detrimental to my life's progress. Why am I scared?

As they say - Kahan se aaya, kahan jaoge, khabar karo apne tan ki

Where have you come from? Where will you go? Ask your own self! 

Life is as fun and peaceful as you can make it. I do not have to be worried about it. I just need to find my peace and enjoy life with a purpose. Today, I think I should be doing GMAT.So I will try, and that is okay!
Let me follow the steps I have written down above, and then stick to it!
