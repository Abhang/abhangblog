title : 'When you have a goal, but can't focus and work hard'

---

I have had this goal for three years, and I am embarrassed that I still haven't ticked the checkbox.

# What Steps should I be taking?

Accountability - Break the goal into small chuncks, and everyday, set aside the time you need with chuncks spread out, and give yourself to it. 
What is my biggest distractor? I don't use any Instagram or WhatsApp that much? YouTube! YouTube is as detrimental to your life goals as any other social media app. Avoid it at all means! 

Let me promise myself, I will not use my phone more than an hour a day. Let us see how I fare on this. 

Will keep you updated!
