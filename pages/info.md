The idea behind *Simplicity* is to build a theme which is elegant, ver&shy;satile but still fast, without any clutter and the pur&shy;pose to make blogging and publishing as easy as possible.

While sketching *Simplicity* I asked myself: »How much can I strip down from a post. How much front matter is truly needed?« And the answer is really simple. To write a post you just need…

{% highlight html %}
---
title: Your Title
---
{% endhighlight %}

…because you can define the default-layout in the *_config.yml*. But what makes this theme truly elegant is, that if you need some tasty video on top of your posting or a nice image, you do it.

{% highlight html %}

title: Your Title
image: image-on-top-of-post.jpg
---
{% endhighlight %}

The layout figures out what to do :)

And if you are a blogger who enjoys to spicing up his posts, there are plenty of possibilities. Maybe like this?!?

{% highlight html %}

subheadline: I love'em
title: Your Title
header_image: amazing_header_image.jpg
comments: true
embed: <iframe>…</iframe>

{% endhighlight %}

I hope you enjoy my theme.

All the best from [Cologne][1], [Moritz »mo.« Sauer][2]
